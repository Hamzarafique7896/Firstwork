            Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is currently the chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party. He succeeded his mother, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, for the position after she was assassinated on December 27, 2007.

            <p>
                Bilawal was born in Karachi on 21 September 1988, three months before Benazir was elected as the first female prime minister of Pakistan. He is the eldest child and only son of Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari, the former President of Pakistan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bilawal has spent most of life abroad as he left Pakistan in 1999 when Benazir went into self-exile with the family dividing time between London and Dubai. He studied at the Rashid School for Boys in Dubai and also received a black belt in taekwondo.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2007, Bilawal Zardari enrolled at Christ Church at the prestigious University of Oxford where he studied history and politics, following in the footsteps of his mother and illustrious grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He also became a part of the Oxford Union debating society, learning a craft that would be useful for a political career.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, a few months later, his mother was assassinated and he was handed the reigns of PPP. Zardari took the co-chairman’s post in order to manage the party until Bilawal finished his education.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bilawal completed his education in June 2010. At the young age of nineteen years, Bilawal inherited the reins the PPP, and started participating in important meetings, along with his father and other senior leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, he made his official political debut in 2012 on the fifth death anniversary of Benazir with an emotionally charged speech.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bilawal was also declared Tumandar (chief) of the Zardari tribe in May 2011 following the demise of his paternal grandfather Hakim Ali Zardari. He has two younger sisters Bakhtawar and Aseefa.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bilawal is probably the youngest party chief in Pakistan and bring more dynamism to the party. Hailing from a political family, Bilawal’s surroundings have been ripe for training understanding the dynamics of Pakistani politics.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he took command Bilawal’s aim was to reorganise the political party to infuse new blood and revitalise the spirit the PPP has been known for since, and to mobilise party workers to play their role in the 2018 elections.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2016, Zardari announced to contest the next elections together with Bilawal. During the 2013 elections, Bilawal was seen as too young and immature to contest the poll. The elections will prove whether he is able to restore the lost glory of the PPP.
